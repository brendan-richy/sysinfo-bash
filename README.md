# Bash System Monitor - Overview

This is a simple command-line powered system monitor that keeps a tab on important information about your system such as CPU temperature, memory load, and charging status.

This project is to help increase my understanding of using bash scripts in the command line, and learn about package managers and distributing software with other people.
